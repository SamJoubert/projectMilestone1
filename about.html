<!-- my biography -->
<div class="biographyText">
<p>My name is Sam Joubert, and I am junior at Kennesaw State University. I am currently studying Information
Technology. I decided to major in this subject because of the freedom it allows. With an IT degree and some
experience, there are not only a large amount of different jobs you can do, but you can work at almost any 
company in the world.</p>
<p>In my free time, I mostly like to play video games and rock climb. These hobbies have stuck with me
for 2 reasons: problem solving and self improvement. Video games and rock climbing both involve planning
through the steps you need to take in order to succeed, which is something I enjoy doing. There is also
a satisfying sense of progression you experience when you get better at video games and become a
stronger rock climber.</p>
<p>My main goals in life are to have a positive impact on the world and be the best version of myself.
In my opinion, these goals are closely interlinked. Helping other people makes you a kinder and better
person, and you also can't help people as effectively if you don't have good qualities, like strength and
intelligence.</p>
